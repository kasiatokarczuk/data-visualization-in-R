# Data Visualization in R - Exercises Repository

This repository contains exercises and examples for data visualization in R using various popular libraries. Each folder corresponds to a specific package or method for creating visualizations, including `lattice`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and base R graphics.
This code was developed during the 3rd semester of Data Science studies at AGH University of Science and Technology.
## Folder Structure

### 1. `lattice`
- Examples and exercises demonstrating the use of the `lattice` package for high-level data visualization.
- Includes:
  - Scatterplots, histograms, and faceted plots.
  - Customization of themes and layouts.

### 2. `ggplot2`
- Examples using the `ggplot2` package, part of the `tidyverse`.
- Includes:
  - Layered graphics with `geom_*` functions.
  - Custom themes and advanced visualization techniques.

### 3. `plotly`
- Interactive plots created with the `plotly` package.
- Includes:
  - 3D scatterplots, line graphs, and bar charts.
  - Custom tooltips and interactive legends.

### 4. `graphics`
- Base R graphics for quick and simple visualizations.
- Includes:
  - Basic plots (`plot()`, `hist()`, `boxplot()`).
  - Customizing axes, legends, and titles.
