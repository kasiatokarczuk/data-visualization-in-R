## Examples

### Examples with `iris` Dataset

1. **Scatter Plot with ggplot2 and plotly**
   - Visualized `Sepal.Length` against `Petal.Length`, colored by `Species`, and made the plot interactive.

2. **Histogram**
   - Created a histogram of `Sepal.Length` with adjustable bins.

3. **Scatter Plot with Markers**
   - Added diamond-shaped markers to a scatter plot.

4. **Filtered Bar Plot**
   - Displayed a bar plot showing counts of `Species` with `Sepal.Length` > 5.

5. **Linear Model Visualization**
   - Added a regression line to a scatter plot using the `lm()` model.

6. **Subplots**
   - Created subplots with different marker styles.

### Exercises with `diamonds` Dataset

1. **Bar Plot**
   - Created a bar plot with `cut` on the X-axis and `clarity` as the fill attribute, made interactive.

2. **Filtered Histogram**
   - Visualized the distribution of `carat` for diamonds with colors from G to J, with custom bin settings.

3. **Scatter Plot with Trend Line**
   - Visualized `carat` vs. `price`, added a regression line, customized the legend, and styled the plot.

4. **Combined Visualizations**
   - Created a layout with a box plot, a histogram, and a 2D histogram.

### Exercises with `gapminder` Dataset

1. **Pie Chart**
   - Created a pie chart showing average `gdpPercap` for each continent with customized slice colors.

2. **Scatter Plot**
   - Visualized `lifeExp` vs. `year` with marker shapes based on `continent`.

3. **Box Plot**
   - Created a box plot of `lifeExp`, grouped by `country` and `continent` with continent-based colors.

4. **Animated Scatter Plot**
   - Visualized `gdpPercap` (log-scaled) vs. `lifeExp` with bubble sizes based on `pop` and animation by `continent`.

5. **Bubble Chart for Asia**
   - Created a bubble chart of `lifeExp` vs. `pop` for Asian countries from 1972-2007, animated by `year`.
