## Examples

### **ggplot2 Examples**

1. **Bar Plot with Fill by Species**:
   - Created a stacked bar plot with proportions of `Sepal.Width` grouped by `Species`.
   - Applied themes and customized legends and titles.

2. **Global Mean Line**:
   - Added a vertical line representing the global mean of `Sepal.Width` on a bar plot.

3. **Scatter Plot with Linear Model**:
   - Generated a scatter plot for `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` colored by `Species`.
   - Added a linear regression line and fixed axis ratio.

### **plotly Examples**

1. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Visualized `Sepal.Length` vs `Petal.Length` using markers.

2. **Filtered Histogram**:
   - Displayed a histogram of `Sepal.Width` for `setosa` species, with custom binning and color.

3. **Custom Marker Scatter Plot**:
   - Enhanced a scatter plot with styled markers and a title.

4. **Interactive Bar Plot**:
   - Counted species with `Sepal.Length > 5` and visualized counts in a bar plot.

5. **Regression Line**:
   - Added a linear model to a scatter plot for `Sepal.Length` and `Petal.Length`.

## Tasks

### **Task 1: ggplot2**
1. Created a scatter plot for the `mtcars` dataset:
   - Plotted `wt` vs `mpg` and used `cyl` as a categorical color.
   - Customized axis titles, background, and panel.

2. Added custom themes to improve aesthetics.

3. Plotted `qsec` vs `mpg` and included median and mean lines for `mpg`.

4. Utilized `geom_smooth()` for trend visualization.

### **Task 2: plotly**
1. Filtered `mtcars` for 4-cylinder cars and created a scatter plot of `mpg` vs `disp`, colored by `am`.

2. Created a 2D histogram for `disp` and `mpg`.

3. Visualized a box plot for `mpg` grouped by `cyl`.
